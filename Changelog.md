## 2.0 | Complete Overhaul

**Released at**: `06/03/2021`

**Notes** : Not Savefile Compatible, the game is going to be way harder, looking way better, and you got a lot more diversity in what you'll encounter. According to my testers, the performance price for this update is 3FPS in the heaviest areas.
